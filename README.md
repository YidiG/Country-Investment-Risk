# Country-Investment-Risk

**Objective:** The main objective of this project is to identify the best country to invest in based on key indicators such as Corruption, Peace Index, Legal Environment, and GDP Growth data of each country.

**Analysis Approach:** To achieve this goal, we employed Hierarchical Clustering and K-Means Clustering algorithms for prediction and analysis. These clustering techniques are used to group countries with similar characteristics, enabling us to identify potential investment opportunities based on the clusters' profiles.

**Data Sources:** The analysis is based on a dataset comprising Corruption Index, Peace Index, Legal Environment scores, and GDP Growth data of various countries. This data is collected from reliable sources and encompasses a comprehensive set of indicators that influence investment risk assessment.

**Methodology:**
1. Data Preprocessing: The data is cleaned, normalized, and prepared for clustering analysis.
2. Hierarchical Clustering: We use hierarchical clustering to identify natural groupings of countries based on their similarities in the specified indicators.
3. K-Means Clustering: K-Means clustering further refines the identified groups, allowing us to pinpoint specific clusters that represent favorable investment opportunities.
4. Investment Risk Ranking: Based on the clustering results and analysis of each cluster's characteristics, we rank the countries within the clusters to determine the best country to invest in.

**Expected Outcomes:** Through this analysis, we expect to identify clusters of countries with similar investment risk profiles. These clusters will help investors to focus their attention on regions that exhibit similar characteristics and potential for returns. The ranking of countries within each cluster will provide a clear indication of the best investment opportunities based on the specified indicators.

**Significance:** The insights obtained from this project can assist investors, businesses, and governments in making informed decisions about international investments. Understanding the investment risk associated with different countries can help mitigate potential risks and capitalize on opportunities in emerging markets or stable economies. Additionally, this analysis can aid policymakers in identifying areas where improvements in Corruption, Peace Index, Legal Environment, and GDP Growth can attract more foreign investments and drive economic growth.

By leveraging the power of Hierarchical Clustering and K-Means Clustering techniques, this project aims to provide valuable recommendations for investors seeking to make strategic decisions for their international investment portfolios.
